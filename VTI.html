<h2>VTI</h2>
<img src="Vanguard.jpg" width="60%">
<p><a href="https://www.etf.com/VTI#overview" target="_blank">VTI</a> is a good choice for investors or traders looking for comprehensive, total-market equity exposure, including micro-caps. The fund offers neutral coverage, making no industry, size or style bets to speak of. The fund is passively managed and remains fully invested at all times. Over its long life the ETF has tracked various broad indexes from Dow Jones, MSCI, and as of June 2013, CRSP. Its current index aligns extremely well with our MSCI benchmark. Our only gripe is common to all Vanguard ETFs: portfolio disclosure is lagged, and reported monthlyâ€”rather than daily.
